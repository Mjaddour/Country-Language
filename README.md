# Country-Language
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook project that integrates with OpenAI's API to perform language-based tasks, with potential use cases such as analyzing or processing language and multimedia content.

Features
OpenAI Integration: Uses OpenAI API for language or AI-driven tasks.
Gradio Interface: Implements a user-friendly graphical interface for interaction.
Audio and Image Processing: Supports handling audio files (via PyDub) and images (via PIL).
Environment Configuration: Reads and validates API keys from .env files.
Requirements
To run this notebook, ensure the following dependencies are installed:

Python 3.8 or higher
Libraries: openai, gradio, pydub, Pillow, python-dotenv, and IPython
You can install all dependencies using:

bash
Copy code
pip install openai gradio pydub Pillow python-dotenv ipython
Setup
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone <repository_url>
cd Country_Language
Create a .env file in the project root and add your OpenAI API key:

env
Copy code
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
Launch the Jupyter Notebook:

bash
Copy code
jupyter notebook Country_Language.ipynb
Usage
Follow the code cells in the notebook sequentially to set up and execute tasks.
The Gradio UI provides a simple interface for user interaction, allowing easy testing and demonstration.
Sample Workflow
Initialize API: Ensure your OpenAI API key is loaded and accessible.
Run Gradio UI: Start the Gradio interface to interact with the project.
Process Media: Utilize features for processing audio and images as needed.
